# Research Results: Go API Server with Layered Architecture

## HTTP Framework Decision

**Decision**: Gin HTTP framework
**Rationale**:
- Most popular Go HTTP framework with excellent performance
- Minimal boilerplate, easy JSON handling
- Extensive middleware ecosystem
- Great documentation and community support

**Alternatives considered**:
- Echo: Similar performance, slightly different API
- Standard net/http: More verbose, requires more boilerplate
- Fiber: Express-like API but smaller ecosystem

## ORM and Database Integration

**Decision**: GORM v2 with PostgreSQL driver
**Rationale**:
- Most mature and feature-rich ORM for Go
- Excellent PostgreSQL support with advanced features
- Built-in migration system
- Strong community and documentation
- Interface-based design supports testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLBoiler: Code generation approach, more performant but less flexible
- Ent: Facebook's ORM, newer but powerful schema-first approach
- Raw SQL with sqlx: More control but higher maintenance

## Mock Generation

**Decision**: Mockery v3
**Rationale**:
- Generates mocks from interfaces automatically
- Excellent testify integration
- Supports complex interface signatures
- Widely adopted in Go community

**Alternatives considered**:
- GoMock: Google's official tool, more complex setup
- Counterfeiter: Simple but less feature-rich
- Manual mocks: Time-consuming and error-prone

## Project Structure Pattern

**Decision**: Go Standard Project Layout with Domain-Driven Design layers
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard layout (golang-standards/project-layout)
- Clear separation of concerns with layered architecture
- Domain logic isolated in internal/domain
- Application-specific code in cmd/api-server/internal
- Infrastructure dependencies properly abstracted

**Layer mapping**:
- Domain Layer: `internal/domain/` (entities, repository interfaces, domain services)
- Application Layer: `cmd/api-server/internal/application/` (use cases)
- Infrastructure Layer: `internal/infrastructure/` (repository implementations, external services)
- Presentation Layer: `cmd/api-server/internal/controller/` (HTTP handlers)

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Test files adjacent to source code with Mockery-generated mocks
**Rationale**:
- Go convention of *_test.go files alongside source
- Easy to find and maintain tests
- Mockery provides clean interface mocks for unit testing
- Supports both unit tests and integration tests

**Test types**:
- Unit tests: Test individual functions with mocks
- Integration tests: Test layer interactions with real database
- Contract tests: Validate API specifications

## Dependency Injection Pattern

**Decision**: Manual dependency injection with constructor functions
**Rationale**:
- Explicit and easy to understand
- No external framework dependency
- Good performance characteristics
- Supports interface-based testing

**Alternatives considered**:
- Wire: Google's compile-time DI, adds complexity
- Fx: Uber's runtime DI framework, overkill for simple API
- Interface-based manual injection: Chosen approach

## Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Custom error types with HTTP status mapping
**Rationale**:
- Domain errors can be mapped to appropriate HTTP status codes
- Maintains separation between domain and HTTP concerns
- Supports detailed error messages and error codes

## Configuration Management

**Decision**: Environment variables with struct binding
**Rationale**:
- 12-factor app compliance
- Type-safe configuration
- Easy testing with different configurations
- Container-friendly deployment

## Migration Strategy

**Decision**: GORM Auto-Migration for development, SQL files for production
**Rationale**:
- Quick development iteration with auto-migration
- Controlled, reviewable migrations for production
- Version control for schema changes

## Performance Considerations

**Decisions made**:
- Connection pooling configured in GORM
- JSON serialization with standard library (sufficient for MVP)
- Structured logging for observability
- Graceful shutdown handling
